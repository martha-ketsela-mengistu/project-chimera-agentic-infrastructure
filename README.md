#Project Chimera: The Agentic Infrastructure
##🚀 Mission
To architect a robust "Factory" for the creation and governance of Autonomous AI Influencers. This project serves as a foundation for digital entities that research trends, generate content, and manage engagement autonomously.

##🏗️ Core Engineering Philosophies
This repository adheres to Spec-Driven Development (SDD).

- **Intent as Truth**: No implementation code is written until the Specification (via GitHub Spec Kit) is ratified.
- **Traceability**: All development "thinking" and execution are recorded via the Tenx MCP Sense server.

- **Agentic Orchestration:** The codebase is designed to be navigated and expanded by AI agent swarms with minimal human conflict.

Successfully configured and connected the Tenx MCP Sense Server to Cursor IDE. Logs
